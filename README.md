This series of tutorials was prepared for a class teaching basic computing skills for biologists, offered in Spring quarter 2015 at UC Davis. They were designed to work on a [Lubuntu virtual machine](https://www.dropbox.com/s/43k63fvpqigwxhm/CompBiol.ova?dl=0) running on [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), but they should work on most Unix systems. You can find the files used as examples [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0145aomghulfqoz/ants.txt?dl=0) and [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/knafoe806oz2cjf/matrix-5214genes.phy?dl=0).
