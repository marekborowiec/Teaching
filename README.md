This series of tutorials was prepared for classes teaching basic computing skills for biologists, initially offered in 2015 at UC Davis and revised for 2020 and 2022 at University of Idaho. They were designed to work on a [Lubuntu virtual machine](https://www.dropbox.com/s/43k63fvpqigwxhm/CompBiol.ova?dl=0) running on [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), but they should work on most Unix systems. You can find the files used as examples [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0145aomghulfqoz/ants.txt?dl=0) and [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/knafoe806oz2cjf/matrix-5214genes.phy?dl=0).
